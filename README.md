## Have middle-class incomes declined since the 1950s?

### Data sources:
1. U.S. Census Bureau - Real Median Family Income in the United States (FRED)
    - Units: 2023 CPI adjusted dollars
2. U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis - Real gross domestic product per capita (FRED)    
    - Units: 2017 Dollars

Since the two datasets are adjusted by different metrics, both real income and GDP were indexed to compare relative growth over time, from 1953 to 2024.
